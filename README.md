Project Title: Black police arresting Whites? : A Machine Learning approach on Ethnicity in Policing

This paper comes up with a comparison of supervised machine learning classifers applied in the dataset of stop and search operations done by UK policing in Essex, Kent and London for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Coding is done using pandas and other libraries in python. Code and dataset are saved in a folder named 'Ethnicity in UK Policing' inside this repo. Dataset are saved separately in folders inside the folders named as 'Essex 2018-20', 'Kent 2018-20' and 'London 2018-20' and the preprocssed data is saved as 'finaldata.csv'. The python code is saved as 'newbias.ipynb'.
